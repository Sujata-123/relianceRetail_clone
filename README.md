I am going to share my journey of working on a team project as a web developer student at Masai School.

So I had a problem statement that I have to create a clone of a website called relianceretail.com . Also I can use my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Advance Javascript, JQuery, slick and cloud flair library and API knowledge.

On Saterday, 30th of October, 2021 all the students at Masai school were divided into a team of six from their respective batches and assigned a project that they had to build within 2 weaks, and on the last day, from every batch best teams would be selected to present their project to the respective Judges. We had to build the project with whatever skills we were taught in unit 1 and unit 2 at Masai school, so in my case, it was HTML, CSS, Javascript ,Advance Javascript and API Request. I was assigned to team 35 and my teammates were sujata singh, Akhil Gupta, Vikash Kumar, Deepak Singh, Ankit Sharma.

## Inputs for beginners-
This was the second project I worked on at Masai, and the things I'm going to share are stuff I realized, will benefit someone new to web development or who is going to work for the very first time on a project. So here it is.

## The outcome and important learning from the project :-
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more such as we could have added timer and there were some more functionalities that could have been done, but yeah the time didn't permitted us to go further. But we will surely improve it. If you want to look at the project then you can go to this GitHub link:
